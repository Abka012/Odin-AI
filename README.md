# Odin-AI

An AI-powered inventory management system for small to medium businesses (SMBs) is a smart, automated solution designed to optimize stock levels, reduce costs, and improve operational efficiency. By leveraging machine learning and predictive analytics, the system analyzes historical sales data, market trends, and seasonal demand to forecast inventory needs accurately. It automatically reorders stock when levels are low, identifies slow-moving items, and suggests discounts or promotions to clear excess inventory. The AI also provides real-time insights into inventory turnover, supplier performance, and potential supply chain disruptions, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions. With user-friendly dashboards and integration capabilities with e-commerce platforms and point-of-sale systems, this system simplifies inventory tracking, minimizes human error, and ensures businesses maintain optimal stock levels to meet customer demand while reducing waste and storage costs.
